    <h1 class="four">The mystery of the haunted mansion...</h1>
    <p class="four"> It all started in the late 1800s in a town called Little Archeveild, it was a night like no other. Sitting in his mansion a noble Kingsley stays alone whilst it rains outside. Suddenly he hears knocking at the front gates, he thinks to himself "oh no there must somebody in the rain!" He rushes to the door only to find a enveloppe and nobody in sight in front of the massive lawn. An then he closes the door confused and then openes the envolope and finds a message "good luck on surviving" he panics sacared that he might but then rembered he was alone. Then suddenly he hears the footsteps of a child running through the halls, but no one was to be seen. Then he hears the the sound of screams then finally it was he's turn said the little girl. He run and start throwing furniture and anything he can find the objects go right through the little girl. Then as he cries for mercy, she says "why did you have to kill me daddy" then in one swift slice she cut his head off.</p>
